    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This portfolio was built to establish a strong professional online presence for freelance
      clients, recruiters, and internship applications. The focus was clarity, speed, and trust.
    </p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Relying only on resumes and GitHub links was limiting. Recruiters needed a single platform
      to quickly evaluate skills, projects, and professionalism.
    </p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>
      I designed and developed a clean, modern portfolio that highlights projects clearly,
      communicates skills instantly, and works smoothly across devices.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Project showcase with live demos</li>
      <li>Clean UI and readable typography</li>
      <li>Responsive design for all devices</li>
      <li>Fast-loading and simple navigation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
      The portfolio is now used as a central professional identity for freelance inquiries
      and internship applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
