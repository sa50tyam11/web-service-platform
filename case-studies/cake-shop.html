Case Study 1: Cake Shop Website
Type: Local Business Website
Problem
The cake shop had no professional online presence. Customers relied only on walk-ins and phone calls. There was no clear way to showcase products, pricing, or encourage inquiries.
Solution
I designed and developed a modern, mobile-friendly website focused on:
Clear product sections
Strong call-to-action buttons
Fast loading and clean UI
Simple layout that non-tech customers can navigate easily
Outcome
The business gained a professional online identity
Customers could browse offerings before contacting
Improved trust and first impression for new customers
Tech Used (short & subtle)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive UI
Who this is for
Local businesses, bakeries, shops, service providers
